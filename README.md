# Indian Election Sentiment Analysis: Rahul Gandhi vs. Narendra Modi

## Overview

This project aims to conduct sentiment analysis on Indian elections, focusing specifically on the public sentiment towards two prominent political figures: Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi. The sentiment analysis will leverage natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text data from various sources such as social media, news articles, and public forums to gauge public opinion.

## Objectives

- Analyze public sentiment towards Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi during Indian elections.
- Identify trends and patterns in sentiment over time and across different demographics.
- Determine the overall sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) towards each political figure.
- Provide insights into the factors influencing public opinion and sentiment.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather text data from diverse sources including Twitter, Facebook, news websites, and public forums using web scraping and API access.
2. **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data by removing noise, stopwords, and special characters. Perform tokenization, lemmatization, and stemming to prepare the text for analysis.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilize NLP libraries such as NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) or spaCy to perform sentiment analysis on the preprocessed text data. Apply sentiment lexicons or machine learning models to classify sentiment polarity.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the sentiment analysis results using plots such as bar charts, line graphs, and word clouds to illustrate sentiment trends and patterns.
5. **Insights Generation**: Interpret the sentiment analysis results to extract insights into public sentiment towards Rahul Gandhi and Narendra Modi. Identify key themes, topics, and sentiments expressed by the public.
